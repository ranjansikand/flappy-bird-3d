# flappy-bird-3d

A simple recreation of Flappy Bird in Unity using standard 3D assets.

Gameplay:
  Pipes are generated in pairs infinitely, with a predefined gap between them. 
  The player-character can jump as they approach the pipes, and score upon passing through the pipes safely.
  Hitting the pipes or the ground is game over.
  
Features:
  Pause function - my previous project did not have a pause function (or true infinity, either), so I added one in this. All gameplay and motion freezes when pause is pressed.
  Start Menu
  High Score tracking - using PlayerPrefs, the high score is maintained through games and displayed on title screen and upon losses
  Sound effects -  several functions feature sound effects from Kenney.nl's "interfaces" sound library
  
Main additions would be graphical, with some additional features like volume muting buttons in the menu/pause screen, music, and random elements to the pipe generation.
